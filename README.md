This is libft, the first project of 42School

for personnal use mainly, check out the code if you want, but I recommend finding your own solutions

to use:

-clone the repo

-go to libft/

-`make`

you are good to go, use the libft.a while compiling to access all the functions of the lib :)

`make debug` adds useful info when using gdb and valgrind

beware, this code is not well optimised, you should honestly use standard libs and your own implementation of some functions if needed.
